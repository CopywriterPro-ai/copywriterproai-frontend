    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a branch of computer science discipline that focuses on creating intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.
      AI technology can be used for a variety of tasks, including:
      <ul class="content-list list-unstyled">

          Coming up with ideas for stories, articles, or blog posts

          Conducting research
        </li>
        <li>
          Generating outlines
        </li>
        <li>
          Writing drafts

      To create an AI system, programmers need to design algorithms, which are sets of rules that govern how the system will operate. Once the algorithms are developed, the AI system can be trained using data. The more data the system is exposed to, the better it can learn and perform its tasks.
